			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>
				As a Full Stack Developer and IT Consultant with over five years of professional experience,
				I offer an ideal combination of technical expertise, strategic foresight, and the ability to
				efficiently and purposefully implement complex projects. My projects include the development
				of customized applications for various industries, with a clear focus on <strong
					>scalability, user-friendliness, and meeting individual client requirements</strong
				>.
			</p>

			<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>

			<p>
				As an expert in both frontend and backend technologies, I am capable of developing <strong
					>robust and high-performance applications</strong
				>
				from a single source. Using modern frameworks such as
				<strong>React/Next.js, Svelte/SvelteKit</strong>, I create
				<strong>appealing, responsive user interfaces</strong>
				that meet the highest standards. On the backend, I leverage my extensive experience with
				<strong>.NET, AWS, and relational database systems like PostgreSQL and MSSQL</strong>.
				Additionally, I have solid expertise in developing
				<strong>cross-platform applications (Web, Android, iOS) using Capacitor.js</strong>,
				ensuring seamless implementation across different platforms.
			</p>

			<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>

			<p>
				Another key focus of my work is <strong>quality assurance</strong>: I design and execute
				<strong>comprehensive testing strategies</strong>
				at all levels - from <strong>unit tests</strong> (e.g. NUnit, Jest) to
				<strong>end-to-end tests</strong> (e.g. Playwright) and
				<strong>mocking solutions with MSW, FakeItEasy, and NSubstitute</strong>. With a structured
				and targeted test strategy, I ensure that the applications I develop are not only
				<strong>error-free</strong>
				but also <strong>long-term maintainable and robust</strong>.
			</p>

			<h2>Automation & Deployment</h2>

			<p>
				For <strong>automation and deployment</strong>, I have extensive experience with modern
				<strong>cloud technologies</strong>
				such as <strong>AWS ECS, AWS Amplify, Docker, and GitHub Actions</strong>. These
				technologies enable <strong>efficient deployments</strong>, allowing more focus on
				development itself. Additionally, I have expertise in implementing
				<strong>secure authentication and authorization systems based on OAuth 2.0</strong>,
				ensuring
				<strong>accessibility (WCAG standards)</strong>
				and <strong>integrating payment systems with Stripe</strong>. With these capabilities, I
				help bring <strong>comprehensive and future-proof products</strong> to life.
			</p>

			<h2>My Approach</h2>

			<p>
				A key priority in my work is developing <strong
					>scalable and maintainable software architectures</strong
				>
				that ensure the long-term success of a project. My goal is not only to create high-quality applications
				but also to structure the development process in a way that keeps
				<strong>efficiency and sustainability</strong> at the core.
